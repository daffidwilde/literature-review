    This survey considers the literature surrounding three essential parts of
    modern operational research: clustering and segmentation, model evaluation,
    and operational healthcare modelling. In particular, this review focuses on
    their intersections, highlighting areas for which there exists a scarce
    amount of published work.

    Given the vast nature of this body of literature, two approaches are
    utilised to thoroughly investigate the corpus. First, a traditional
    literature review based on a selection of seminal, innovative and recent
    works from each topic are digested; therein, any overlapping literature is
    discussed. Second, a software-based study of the wider literature base from
    five publishers (including preprint servers), providing insight into the
    bibliometrics of the literature associated with the aforementioned topics.
