\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Modern research, as with many aspects of modern life, is highly dependent on the
use of electronic data. To properly utilise any amount of data, algorithms must
be designed and implemented that reveal insights into said data. Healthcare
modelling is one crucial (albeit broad) branch of research in which decisions
are increasingly being informed by data-driven methodologies. A common and
effective methodology used to better understand a healthcare population
operationally is the segmentation or partitioning of some associated dataset
into homogeneous parts; this often falls under the umbrella term `clustering'. 
Regardless of the particular methods that are implemented in any real-world
setting, the quality of methodology must be evaluated as being `good'. The ways
in which this evaluation is carried out is linked to the methods themselves, but
there are some common approaches used in all fields of research such as
consensus by literature or beating some rival method(s) according to a metric on
a dataset.

This survey considers the literature surrounding these three pillars of
modern operational research --- clustering, the evaluation of methodologies, and
healthcare modelling --- as well as their intersections. Studying this vast body
of literature is achieved using two approaches:

\begin{itemize}
    \item In Section~\ref{sec:review}, a `typical' review of a selection of
        representative and innovative publications from across the
        aforementioned research topics;
    \item in Section~\ref{sec:bibliometric}, a software-based bibliometric study
        of the literature from five leading academic publishers and pre-print
        hosts.
\end{itemize}

% TODO Summarise the interest of this survey:
%       -[x] the key research areas and their intersections
%       -[ ] a nice Venn diagram (made using the bibliometric study)
%       -[ ] highlight the broader points where overlaps exist
%       -[ ] lay out the general structure of the article
