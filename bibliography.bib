Recent work has disproved this by incorporating efficient nearest neighbour searching algorithms into the clustering algorithms. A general framework for hierarchical, agglomerative clustering algorithms is discussed here, which opens up the prospect of much improvement on current, widely-used algorithms. This ‘progress report’ details new algorithmic approaches in this area, and reviews recent results.}},
