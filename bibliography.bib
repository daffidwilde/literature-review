@article{Murtagh1983,
    abstract = {{It has often been asserted that since hierarchical clustering algorithms require pairwise interobject proximities, the complexity of these clustering procedures is at least O(N2). Recent work has disproved this by incorporating efficient nearest neighbour searching algorithms into the clustering algorithms. A general framework for hierarchical, agglomerative clustering algorithms is discussed here, which opens up the prospect of much improvement on current, widely-used algorithms. This ‘progress report’ details new algorithmic approaches in this area, and reviews recent results.}},
